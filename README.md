# PacmanGame
We practice extending the source code from the website.  we find a classic game, and try to read this code and add some functions.
2 modifications:
(1) in Form1.cs, we use "for loop" to shorten the code.
(2) in Enemy.cs, we seperate "class Pacman" from it.

4 additional functions:
(1) No Enemy -> create an Enemy.
(2) add timer so that Enemy can chase Pacman.
(3) add simple AI to the Enemy.
(4) add a Function on Purple Dots, which can make the Enemy back to the original location.
